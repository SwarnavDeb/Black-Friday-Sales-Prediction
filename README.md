# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
In this project, I have done EDA (graph visualization) on Black Friday sales dataset.  Performed data modelling, pre-processing, and applied a predictive algorithm which determines the purchase amount. XGBRegression had the best fit having the lowest error.

#### Dataset Information

This dataset comprises of sales transactions captured at a retail store. Itâ€™s a classic dataset to explore and expand your feature engineering skills and day to day understanding from multiple shopping experiences. This is a regression problem. The dataset has 550,069 rows and 12 columns.

**Problem:** To predict purchase amount
